  ## About
  Eighty years after the launch of the German war of annihilation against the Soviet Union, reams of folders containing the first transcribed voices of survivors of German occupation have surfaced in former Soviet archives. Their creation was the work of historians from Moscow, Kyiv, and Minsk who set out to document the history of “German-fascist” occupation on Soviet soil.

  This site presents 700 interviews that the historians conducted with Soviet witnesses in Russian, Ukrainian, Belarusian, and Baltic regions, which had previously fallen under Nazi occupation. The purpose of the project is to explore the range and the contours of a Soviet experience of “German-fascist” rule.  Most of the witnesses were women and older people who had been left behind in the Soviet evacuation effort and experienced the full brunt of the Nazi occupation regime. Their testimonies detail encounters with the occupiers and atrocities that have hitherto remained outside the historical record; beyond this, they offer insights into the distinct ways Soviet survivors tried to make sense of traumatic events, using categories available to them.

  Soviet suffering, this project makes clear, was an integral chapter of the histories of the Holocaust and the Second World War. Recent initiatives such as Father Patrick Desbois’s “Holocaust by Bullets” documentation, or Yad Vashem’s exploration of the murder sites of the Jews in the occupied territories of the former USSR, have begun to map the “Holocaust on Soviet soil.” Yet their focus on the murder of 2.75 million Soviet Jews skirts millions of POWs, other suspected “Bolsheviks,” partisans, and slave workers who also lost their lives in Germany’s campaign of annihilation in the East. The crucial Soviet chapter in modern history’s most terrible war demands to be further explored.
