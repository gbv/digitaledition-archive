  ## Soviet Survivors of Nazi Occupation: The First Testimonies
  Scholars agree that Germany’s war of annihilation against the Soviet Union and its people ranks among the most harrowing chapters of the Second World War. And yet, how Soviet citizens experienced German rule remains a largely unexplored question – up until now.

  An international team of historians has recovered from archives in Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus the voices of hundreds of Soviet survivors of Nazi rule. The survivors spoke with historians from Moscow, Kyiv, and Minsk who trailed the Red Army on its path of re-conquest of German-occupied soil between 1942 and 1945. Small teams of one interviewer and one stenographer each visited smoldering towns and villages in Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus, where they sat down to speak with eyewitnesses, stenographing each of their words.

  The historians were determined to create a comprehensive ground-level documentation for a future history of the Soviet war against Nazi Germany. But they were not able to write this history, and the precious records that they assembled in wartime fell into oblivion. This website seeks to recover for interested scholars and general readers the work of the Soviet historians. It presents more than 700 interviews with a wide range of survivors ranging from partisans and underground fighters to rural and industrial workers, scientists, teachers, students, and housewives.

  The documents are presented in the original Russian, Ukrainian, and Belarusian languages. A selection of the interviews is also available in English and German translation.
